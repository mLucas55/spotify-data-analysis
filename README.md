# A data driven exploration of the most streamed songs on Spotify as of September 2023.

* Following the completion of a group project for my Fundementals of Data Science class, I wanted to continue my research and analysis of trends among the top streamed songs on Spotify.

* This Jupyter Notebook consists of me importing data -> sanitizing the data -> posing questions -> answering questions.

* Each question is answered with a code to create an appropriate graph and a summary of said graph.

* This is a work in progress that I intend to use as the starting point for a TensorFlow project on hit song prediction

* The data set was sourced from a trusted contributer on Kaggle, and the information that makes up the set was pulled directly from Spotify's provided API. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/top-spotify-songs-2023
