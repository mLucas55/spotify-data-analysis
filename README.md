# spotify-data-analysis
A data driven exploration of the most streamed songs on Spotify as of September 2023.

Following the completion of a group project for my Fundementals of Data Science class, I wanted to continue my research.

This Jupyter Notebook consists of me importing data -> sanitizing the data -> posing questions -> answering questions.

Each question is answered with a code to create an appropriate graph and a summary of said graph.
